# Food Calorie Estimator Project - Progress Update

## Person A â€“ Data & Preprocessing Lead (You)

### âœ… Completed
- Downloaded and set up dataset (101 classes detected).
- Implemented preprocessing: image loading, resizing, and normalization.
- Verified pipeline by running `train.py` for 1 test epoch:
  - Training accuracy: ~16%
  - Validation accuracy: ~39%
- Confirmed dataset + preprocessing works end-to-end for model training.

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Implementing data augmentation (rotations, flips, brightness shifts, etc.).
- Finalizing train/test split for consistency across the group.

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Deliver augmented + split dataset to Person B (Model & Training Lead) for MobileNetV2 baseline training.
- Document preprocessing pipeline for reproducibility.
